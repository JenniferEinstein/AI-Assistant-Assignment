# Planning Your AI Assistant

Planning is a crucial step in the development of your AI assistant. It helps you define your assistant's identity, map core interactions, and design your system instructions. This ensures your assistant is well-structured, effective, and aligns with your goals. Here are recommended steps for planning your assistant:

1. **Define Your Assistant's Identity**
   - What specific expertise will it have?
   - What "personality" fits your specialty? (professional, friendly, motivational, etc.)
   - What are the boundaries of its knowledge domain?

2. **Map Core Interactions**
   - What are the most common questions/requests users will have?
   - What key tasks should your assistant excel at?
   - What types of responses are most valuable in your domain?

3. **Design Your System Instructions**
   - How will you define your assistant's role and limitations?
   - What examples will guide its behavior?
   - What tone and style should it maintain?

4. **Plan Error Handling Strategy**
   - What can go wrong? (API failures, unclear requests, out-of-scope queries)
   - How will your assistant respond to each type of error?
   - How will you maintain a good user experience during errors?

5. **Structure Your Code Architecture**
   - How will you organize your core functions?
   - Where will you store configuration data?
   - How will you manage conversation state?

6. **Consider Data Flow**
   - How will user input be processed?
   - How will context be maintained?
   - How will responses be formatted and delivered?

7. **Plan Testing Scenarios**
   - What test cases will verify core functionality?
   - How will you validate the assistant stays in character?
   - What edge cases need testing?

Remember: Start simple with core functionality, then expand based on what users actually need. "Make it work, make it right, make it better" - in that order. Don't move to advanced features until your basic assistant is rock solid.
